	<p>I attened the GeekList Hack4Good Hackathon 2014. Working with MSF we listened to their current problems. One particular issue stood out. The inability of good communication in disaster areas, without a clear image of the situation on the ground it is extremely dificult to distribute the resouces fairly. We worked intensively for over 48 hours to create a demo that solved the communication problem.</p>
	<p>Our priorities:<ul>
		<li>Must work in areas without internet</li>
		<li>Work with low end phones (not only smartphones)</li>
		<li>Must be reliable</li>
	</ul></p>
