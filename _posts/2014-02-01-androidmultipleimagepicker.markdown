<div class="narrow-section">
	<p>Android multiple image picker is to solve a problem I occured while working on another project. The problem is that android does not allow you to pick more than one image from the gallery with an intent.</p>
	<p>I decided to make it open source so other people dont have to reinvent a solution as I did.</p>
