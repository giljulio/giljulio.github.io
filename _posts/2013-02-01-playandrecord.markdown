	<p>This project was undertaken as part of a degree module called 'Real World Projects'. Our team chose to do the Coventry University Application. The aim of the application was to connect all the university services. With another team member I was in charge of the android application and the web services. The main challenge was to make the IOS and android app look and feel the same while following android design guidelines.  </p>
